# 🖼️ Mouse Trail Image Animation (GSAP + JavaScript)

This project creates a **smooth image trail effect** that follows the mouse cursor inside a centered container.  
It uses **GSAP** for animations and a custom **throttle function** to avoid performance issues.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Mousemove event generates floating image cards.  
- Images smoothly **reveal** (slide up) and **hide** (slide down).  
- Old images automatically disappear after animation.  
- **Throttle function** prevents lag by limiting how often elements are created.  
- Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP**.
